		<h2>Chapter1:Introduction to Me</h2>
	
		<p class="intro">My name is Margaret, but I go by Maggie. I grew up in a small town in Nebraska. <span class="sentence">I love the summer. </span>It is the best time of year.</p>

		<p class="normal">I love living in Nebraska. <span class="sentence">It is so wonderful and peaceful here.</span> I love Nebraska in the summer because I get to hang out with my family more. They are not working or going to school.</p>

		<p class="normal">I also love reading. I read a lot of different books. Currently I really enjoy reading young adult books. <span class="sentence">They are always fun and relaxing to read.</span></p>
		<p class="normal">But out of all of the things I love being with my family. It is so fun to hang out with children and husband. <span class="sentence">There is nothing better than a warm day with my family.</span> We go to the park, walk the dog, or just hang out at home watching movies.</p>
